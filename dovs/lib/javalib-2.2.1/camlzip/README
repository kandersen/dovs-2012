                        The CamlZip library

DESCRIPTION:

This Objective Caml library provides easy access to compressed files in ZIP
and GZIP format, as well as to Java JAR files.  It provides functions
for reading from and writing to compressed files in these formats.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Objective Caml 3.06 or up.

- Findlib library

- The Zlib C library, version 1.1.3 or up.  If it is not installed on
  your system (look for libz.a or libz.so), get it from
  http://www.gzip.org/.  If you are running Linux or BSD, chances
  are that your distribution provides precompiled binaries for this
  library.

INSTALLATION:

- Edit the three variables at the beginning of the Makefile to reflect
  the location where Zlib is installed on your system.  The defaults
  are OK for Linux.

- Do "make all".

- Become super-user if necessary and do
         make install
  This installs the library in the standard Findlib Objective Caml library
  directory.

DOCUMENTATION:

See the comments in files zip.mli and gzip.mli.

Use the standard ocamlfind command to compile and link with the library. Eg.:
ocamlfind ocamlc -package zip -c test.ml
ocamlfind ocamlc -package zip -linkpkg test.ml
ocamlfind ocamlopt -package zip -linkpkg test.ml


The directory test/ contains examples of using this library.

This file and the Makefile have been modified by Laurent Hubert (CNRS)in order
to use Findlib (to simplify the usage of the library).
