<h2>Installation Procedure for Javalib</h2>


<h3>For the impatient, familiar, or audacious</h3>

<ol>
  <li><span class="code">tar xf javalib-2.2.1.tar.bz2</span></li>
  <li><span class="code">cd javalib-2.2.1</span></li>
  <li><span class="code">./configure.sh</span></li>
  <li>if there are missing dependencies,
  <ul> 
    <li>if ptrees was not found,<br />
    <span class="code">make ptrees &amp;&amp; make installptrees</span>
    </li>
    <li>if camlzip was not found,<br />
    <span class="code">make camlzip &amp;&amp; make installcamlzip</span>
    </li>
    <li>if extlib was not found,<br />
    <span class="code">make extlib &amp;&amp; make installextlib</span>
    </li>
    <li>once all dependencies have been installed,<br />
      <span class="code">./configure.sh</span>
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><span class="code">make &amp;&amp; make install</span></li>

<h3>Detailed instructions</h3>

<ol class="detailedinstructions">

<li> Javalib makes extensive use of
the <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">Findlib</a>
package manager (&gt;=1.2.3) and its Ocamlfind front-end, which provide seamless
management of OCaml libraries. Make sure you have an Objective Caml compiler
(&gt;=3.10.0) installed, as well as the findlib/ocamlfind tools.
</li>

<li> Javalib depends on three unrelated libraries: ExtLib (&gt;=1.5.1), CamlZip
(&gt;=1.03), and PTrees.  Some or all of these libraries might be provided as
precompiled packages or ports in your operating system. E.g., for ExtLib, one
can use:
<ul>
  <li>the 'libextlib-ocaml-dev' package in Ubuntu,</li>
  <li>the 'ocaml-extlib' package in Fedora or in Mac/Darwin Ports.</li>
</ul>
If your operating system provides none (or only part of) these libraries, fret
not: all three are included in the Javalib distribution, and the installation
procedure will guide you through compiling and installing them.
</li>

<li> First you need to configure the system. It is done automatically with the
command:
<dl class="code">
  <dd>./configure.sh [options]</dd>
</dl>
For a list of options accepted by the configuration script,
run <span class="code">./configure.sh -h</span>. The main options are:
<dl>
  <dt>
    <span class="code">-l [&lt;dir&gt;]</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>Proceed to install in the local
    directory <span class="code">&lt;dir&gt;</span>.</dd>
  <dt><span class="code">-l default</span></dt>
  <dd>Proceed to install in the default local directory ('./lib').</dd>
  <dt>
    <span class="code">-d yes|no|prof</span> (default:
    <span class="code">yes</span>)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Set to <span class="code">yes</span> to keep debugging information in native
    library or to <span class="code">prof</span> to profile (with gprof) your
    program.
  </dd>
</dl>

<em>Note: The configure script assumes that, if the ptrees and camlzip
installations are local, then the Javalib install will also be local.  Moreover,
it assumes that all of them will reside in the same ./lib folder.</em>
<br /><br />

The configuration script generates a file called "Makefile.config". You are
welcome to review and edit it, but keep in mind it will be overwritten with
each execution of configure.sh.
</li>

<li> Step 3 will have stated which of the libraries CamlZip, PTrees, or ExtLib
needed to be compiled and installed. For each of those required, run the
following commands:
<dl>
  <dd><span class="code">make LIBRARYNAME</span></dd>
  <dd><span class="code">make installLIBRARYNAME</span> (if configure was run with the --local option)</dd>
  <dd><span class="code">sudo make installLIBRARYNAME</span> (else)</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li> Now we can check if the dependencies are correctly found---remember to run
  the script with the same options as in step 3.
  <ul class="code">
    <li>./configure.sh [options]</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li> We can now proceed to the Javalib compilation. In the toplevel directory,
enter:
<dl>
  <dd><span class="code">make</span></dd>
  <dd><span class="code">make install</span> (if configure was run with the --local option)</dd>
  <dd><span class="code">sudo make install</span> (otherwise)</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li> If you want the documentation, run:
<dl class="code">
  <dd>make doc</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li> Finally, you can clean the sources with:
<dl class="code">
  <dd>make clean</dd>
</dl>
</li>

</ol>
