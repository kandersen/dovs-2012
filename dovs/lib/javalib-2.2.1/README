Introduction

   Javalib is a library to parse Java .class files into OCaml data
   structures, thus enabling the OCaml programmer to extract information
   from class files, to manipulate and to generate valid .class files.

   It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (see
   LICENSE file).
About this Version

   This version (2.2.1) adds some utility functions and fixes minor bugs.
   This version (2.2) adds support for the attribute
   LocalVariableTypeTable which is the LocalVariableTable for generics
   added in Java 5. It also fixes some minor bugs detailled in the
   CHANGELOG file (Caution: string output of function JPrint.class_name
   with option ~jvm:true has changed).
Some History

   Javalib was initially developped by Nicolas Cannasse.

   It has then been maintained by
     * Frédéric Besson (INRIA)
     * Laurent Hubert (INRIA)
     * Étienne André (INRIA) (bugfix on the wide instructions)
     * Tiphaine Turpin (Université de Rennes 1) (JFile and unparsing
       feature)
     * Tiphaine Turpin (Université de Rennes 1) and Laurent Hubert (CNRS)
       (high level representation of classes)
     * Laurent Hubert (CNRS) (pretty printers, lazy parsing)
     * Nicolas Barre (INRIA) (Hash consing)
Documentation

   If you need documentation, you can:
     * read the on-line [1]tutorial
     * read the on-line [2]API documentation
     * make the documentation (see INSTALL file) and read starting from
       javalib/doc/api/index.html
     * browse the .mli files in the source
     * read the [3]Java Virtual Machine Specifications for more
       information about the class file format
     * post a message or send an email (see [4]Contacts)

   Javalib is distributed with an implementation of the Patricia trees.
   The documentation is in the interface files in javalib/ptrees/.
