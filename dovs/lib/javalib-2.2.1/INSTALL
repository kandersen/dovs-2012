Installation Procedure for Javalib

  For the impatient, familiar, or audacious

    1. tar xf javalib-2.2.1.tar.bz2
    2. cd javalib-2.2.1
    3. ./configure.sh
    4. if there are missing dependencies,
          + if ptrees was not found,
            make ptrees && make installptrees
          + if camlzip was not found,
            make camlzip && make installcamlzip
          + if extlib was not found,
            make extlib && make installextlib
          + once all dependencies have been installed,
            ./configure.sh
    5. make && make install

   You may need superuser rights for the installation phases.

  Detailed instructions

    1. Javalib makes extensive use of the [1]Findlib package manager
       (>=1.2.3) and its Ocamlfind front-end, which provide seamless
       management of OCaml libraries. Make sure you have an Objective Caml
       compiler (>=3.10.0) installed, as well as the findlib/ocamlfind
       tools.
    2. Javalib depends on three unrelated libraries: ExtLib (>=1.5.1),
       CamlZip (>=1.03), and PTrees. Some or all of these libraries might
       be provided as precompiled packages or ports in your operating
       system. E.g., for ExtLib, one can use:
          + the 'libextlib-ocaml-dev' package in Ubuntu,
          + the 'ocaml-extlib' package in Fedora or in Mac/Darwin Ports.
       If your operating system provides none (or only part of) these
       libraries, fret not: all three are included in the Javalib
       distribution, and the installation procedure will guide you through
       compiling and installing them.
    3. First you need to configure the system. It is done automatically
       with the command:

                ./configure.sh [options]

       For a list of options accepted by the configuration script, run
       ./configure.sh -h. The main options are:

        -l [<dir>]
                Proceed to install in the local directory <dir>.

        -l default
                Proceed to install in the default local directory
                ('./lib').

        -d yes|no|prof (default: yes)
                Set to yes to keep debugging information in native library
                or to prof to profile (with gprof) your program.

       Note: The configure script assumes that, if the ptrees and camlzip
       installations are local, then the Javalib install will also be
       local. Moreover, it assumes that all of them will reside in the
       same ./lib folder.
       The configuration script generates a file called "Makefile.config".
       You are welcome to review and edit it, but keep in mind it will be
       overwritten with each execution of configure.sh.
    4. Step 3 will have stated which of the libraries CamlZip, PTrees, or
       ExtLib needed to be compiled and installed. For each of those
       required, run the following commands:

                make LIBRARYNAME
                make installLIBRARYNAME (if configure was run with the
                --local option)
                sudo make installLIBRARYNAME (else)

    5. Now we can check if the dependencies are correctly found---remember
       to run the script with the same options as in step 3.
          + ./configure.sh [options]
    6. We can now proceed to the Javalib compilation. In the toplevel
       directory, enter:

                make
                make install (if configure was run with the --local
                option)
                sudo make install (otherwise)

    7. If you want the documentation, run:

                make doc

    8. Finally, you can clean the sources with:

                make clean
